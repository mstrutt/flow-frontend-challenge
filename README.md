# Flow MADRS-s Coding Challenge

[![Built with open-wc recommendations](https://img.shields.io/badge/built%20with-open--wc-blue.svg)](https://github.com/open-wc)

A couple of features to highlight:

* WCAG 2.0 Accessibility compliant - tested both with automated tools and screen readers
* 2 of the colours were tweaked slightly from the designs to align with colour contrast guidelines (see index.html for comment)
* Supports enhanced contrast from user preferences to further enhance colour contrast
* Supports the prefers-reduced-motion user preference to make any transitions/animations instantanious

## Quickstart

To get started:

```sh
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
